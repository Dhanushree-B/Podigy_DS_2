# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“Š Task 02  
#  Objective
The goal of this task is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset, identifying trends, patterns, and relationships between variables. The task simulates working with real-world data, including handling missing values and generating visual insights.

#  Dataset
While the original task references the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, a manually created sample dataset based on Titanic's schema is used in this project to eliminate the need for external files.

#  Tools & Technologies
Python 3

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

#  Data Cleaning Steps
Checked for missing values

Imputed missing age values using the median age

Ensured all data types were appropriate for analysis

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The following visualizations and statistics were used to explore the dataset:

Survival Count â€“ Bar chart showing survival vs. non-survival counts.

Survival by Gender â€“ Visualization of how gender affected survival rates.

Age Distribution â€“ Histogram to observe the distribution of passenger ages.

Fare Distribution â€“ Distribution plot of ticket fares to detect skewness.

Correlation Heatmap â€“ To understand relationships between numerical variables.

#  How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
